    <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
    <p> This is my first HTML5 page, created with Visual Studio Code!</p>
    <p> This is just a journey on how I started this.
        I was starting to get bored and overwhelmed of doing the same thing.
        I needed to learn something new.<p>
    <p> Here is how I started:<p>
    <p> On August 14th, I watched <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJGyT3C-Y0?si=2TrJhJ1rLRpznIFn">TravisMedia</a> and got some encouragement from there.
    <p>  August 15th- Watched the video again and took some notes then made a list of what to learn first.</p>  
    <p>August 16th - Started learning</p>
