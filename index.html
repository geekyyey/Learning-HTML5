    <p> This is my first HTML5 page, created with Visual Studio Code!</p>
    <p> This is just a journey on how I started to re-learn how to code.<p>

    </p> I setup my first webpage when I was 14, but the computer was not mine. It was my sister's and when she moved, she took the computer with her, so I didn't continue learning.
        <p> Started working in tech support in 2014 doing simple passwords reset. 
            My first real tech job was in 2015 and since then, I have done everything from profiling a Windows computer and MacBook to setting up accounts.</P>
        I wasn't moving ahead at work. 
        Even though I showed an interest in learning and joining other teams, other people or their friends got the opportunity to join instead.
        <p>Since I wasn't going anywhere, I started to get overwhelmed of doing the same thing at work. I wasn't given a chance so then I began to learn something new.<p>
    <p> I looked online for Software Developer classes, but they are too expensive and I just cannot afford another expense since I am already spending money on my own college education.</p>
    <p> Here is how I started:<p>
    <p> On August 14th, I watched <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJGyT3C-Y0?si=2TrJhJ1rLRpznIFn" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TravisMedia</a> and got some encouragement from there. <!-- opens a page in a new tab -->
    <p>  August 15th- Watched the video again and took some notes then made a list of what to learn first.</p>  
    <p>August 16th - Started learning:
                       First, I Googled the different ways to learn.
                       I bought a book that I tried to follow called HTML & CSS QuickStart Guide: <a href="https://a.co/d/cezF8Ik" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">by David DuRocher on Amazon </a> <br> <!-- opening a page in a new tab -->
                       I also use ChatGPT to guide me. Very helpful because I ask questions, it answers me and I learn faster because it feels as if I have an instructor there that I can ask questions when I have doubts. 
                    </p>
    <p>Then, I setup the tools I needed:
                   Installed Visual Studio
                   Installed Chrome and Mozilla Firefox. I already had Edge installed.
                   Setup Visual Studio then installed extension Live Server.
                </p>
    <p> Wrote my first basic HTML5 code and added my first link to give credit to the YouTuber that inspired me to learn HTML again.</p>
    <p>August 18th - Created a new repository in my GitHub account: <a href="https://github.com/geekyyey/Learning-HTML5" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Learning-HTML5</a> <!-- opening a page in a new tab -->
    <p>Part of the learning process was to add an image to the site. This is an image of a trip to Maui:</p> 
    <img src="images/YeyinMaui.jpg" alt="Best place to go hiking."

</p> I will now track what time I start practicing coding and what time I finish. Today I started at 0500 and stopped for breaks. I am stopping at 10:24.</p>
<p> Starting at 0943. I am up to date with all my work and can practice coding while I wait for someone to reach out for help. </p>
Stopped at 0948 to help an exec and back to coding at 1002.
I have to confess, this is a little like a diary. Stopped again at 1002.
<p>8/20/2024 started at 1730. Decided to dedicate the site to my IT Skills with what I have learned of HTML so far and incorporate CSS. Stopped at 22:18</p>
<p>8/22/2024 started practicing at 1900 and stopped at 2145.</p>
