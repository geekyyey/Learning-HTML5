    <title>My First HTML5 Page</title>

    <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
    <p> This is my first HTML5 page, created with Visual Studio Code!</p>
    <p> This is just a journey on how I started to re-learn how to code.<p>

    </p> I setup my first webpage when I was 14, but the computer was not mine. It was my sister's and when she moved, she took the computer with her, so I didn't continue learning.
        <p> Years later, I was starting to get overwhelmed of doing the same thing.</P>
        I wasn't moving ahead at work. Even though I showed an interest in learning and joining other teams, other people or their friends got the opportunity to join instead.
        <p>I needed to learn something new.<p>
    <p> Here is how I started:<p>
    <p> On August 14th, I watched <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJGyT3C-Y0?si=2TrJhJ1rLRpznIFn">TravisMedia</a> and got some encouragement from there.
    <p>  August 15th- Watched the video again and took some notes then made a list of what to learn first.</p>  
    <p>August 16th - Started learning. First, I setup the tools I needed:</p>
    <p>Installed Visual Studio</p>
    <p>Installed Chrome and Mozilla Firefox. I already had Edge installed</p>
    <p> Setup Visual Studio then installed extension Live Server </p>
    <p> Wrote my first basic HTML5 code and added my first link to give credit to the YouTuber that inspired me to learn HTML again.</p>
    <p> August 18th - Created a new repository in my Github account: <a href="https://github.com/yeyintech/Learning-HTML5">Learning-HTML5</a>
